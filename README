## Creating your own facet

Create your facet so that it can respond to a POST request that contains
a JSON payload with, among other things, the url which you are annotating.

It should respond to the request with whatever information you want to add.

Secondly, enable the facet by adding it to `src/config/article.yml` or 
`src/config/homepage.yml` depending on whether you're annotating the homepage
or articles.

In the config file, you can specify any dependencies, so if your facet depends
on another one having run first you can indicate that. For example, you need to 
first extract the body text before you can do a word count.
